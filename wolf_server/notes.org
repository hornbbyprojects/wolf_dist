WIZARD: YOU MUST RETRIEVE THE HORN OF HORNS
IT IS GUARDED BY A DRAGON
THROUGH A RAVINE FILLED WITH SKELETONS
IN A BED OF GOLD
^ this sucked

Maybe some dangerous fauna? Survival in an alien world
Break time - think up some of these fauna
Web Spiders (Hunt using webs, but strange + magical effects when stepping on them)
Wolves <- Traditional
The pack bays for your blood....
WOLF LEADER, many stages, ridiculous number of wolves
Stage 1: Wolf leader stands by, harassed by scouts
Stage 2: Onslaught - Wave after wave of wolves attacks rapidly
Stage 3: Wolf leader attacks you personally in the middle of the waves
Stage 4: The dead (numerous) begin to rise

Question - What is magic?
Potential answer - wizards desire to become other than human
Paths:
Necromancer (death, become corpse)
Obviously raise dead
Fade away, fight via minions, not accessible 

Mutant (Change, gain ridiculous abilities)
Choose alternatives for each bodypart
Legs: Quadriped (speed), Charger (dash), sluglike treads (??? - 
Head: Mandibles (fatal attack), Eye mass (allows dropping eyes, regrowing whole body from them), Chimeric head (spell duplication)
Body: etc

  
Paladin (Idealism)
- Every x time, heal and reset cooldowns, dispel
